# Attraction Authorisation

Look, our layout developers have made the form, now itâ€™s your turn to implement simple logic. Read value from the inputs
and display the authorisation verdict in corresponding fields. For example: when the user types 90 in `weight` input it
should display `Ok` in the `Weight` display.

## Acceptance criteria:
- `Height` verdict is displayed when the value is entered in the `height` input
- If `height` less than `150` display `Too short`, if more than `200` - `Too high`, otherwise - `Ok`
- `Weight` verdict is displayed when the value is entered in the `weight` input
- If `weight` less than `40` display `Too thin`, if more than `110` - `Overweight`, otherwise - `Ok`
- If the there is a negative or no value then it should display `Awaiting`. Applied for `height` and `weight` verdicts
